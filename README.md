# Streaming Telemetry with NETCONF

Implement streaming based performance monitoring (PM) using NETCONF notifications. This project uses Cisco/Tail-F ConfD as the NETCONF stack to implement streaming which relies on emitting NETCONF notifications.

This project has been done in the context of the following demonstration:
